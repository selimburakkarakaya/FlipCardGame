##

This JavaScript game implements a simple flipcard game where the user must match cards. The game creates a score by using time and number of moves to match symbols within cards.

How to play?

1. At the beginning, the program randomly determines the order and symbols of the cards and starts the game.

2. When the user clicks on the backs of the cards, the cards rotate and the symbols become visible.

3. The user tries to match the symbols on the cards by clicking on two cards in turn.

4. Each move of the user is recorded as a score and matched cards are disabled.

5. The game ends when the user matches all the cards or the time limit runs out.

Features:

  - Timer: The game includes a timer that must be completed within a certain period of time. The user loses time with each move and the game ends when time reaches zero.

  - Score Tracking: Every move the user makes is recorded as a score and shown to the user. The user can develop strategies to achieve a higher score in fewer moves.

  - Card Shuffle: The game offers a different level of difficulty each time the game is played by shuffling the cards at each start or when requested by the user.

This fun and challenging game helps the user improve memory, attention and strategy skills.
